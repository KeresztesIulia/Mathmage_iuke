# About the project

This Unity game was created as my Bachelor's Thesis at the University of Copenhagen.

The goal of the project was to create a short escape room using the method of gamification to combine an entertaining game with the topic of integration. The project was written in C# using the Unity game engine, while the 3D models were done in Blender and the textures in Ibis Paint.

# Repository structure

The playable game can be found in the "game" folder, while the Unity project can be opened by adding the "mathmage project" folder in the Unity Hub.
