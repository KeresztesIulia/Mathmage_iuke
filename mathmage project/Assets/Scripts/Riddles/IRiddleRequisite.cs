// What about the places where an object might have to be? are those requisites?
// I mean... yeah, the place and the object are both requisites in a sense, the place has to "contain" the object,
// in a sense...
// Also how is this a class? An interface, at most, maybe, or idk, just, how do I actually attach this to an object?
